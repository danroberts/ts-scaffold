# ts-scaffold

This is my personal scaffolding for new typescript projects -- intentially left
very bare bones, I wouldn't recommend using this if you are not me. 

## Getting Started

You'll need to install yarn if you don't have it already.
`$ brew install yarn`

Install dependencies:
`$ yarn install`

Run the test(s):
`$ karma start`
